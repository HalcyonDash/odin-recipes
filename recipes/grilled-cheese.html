        <h2>Caprese Grilled Cheese with Mushrooms</h2>
        <p>This is a grilled cheese originally from a restaurant in my home town.</p>
        <p>While I like the original, I can no longer get it where I live, and I have changed some of its preparation and, I think, improved it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Baguette, sliced</li>
            <li>Baby Swiss Cheese</li>
            <li>Portabella Mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>Baby spinach</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil, chopped</li>
            <li>Fresh Tomato</li>
            <li>Olive Oil & Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice tomato.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan (two pans are ideal).</li>
            <li>Roast sliced mushrooms until cooked.</li>
            <li>In same or separate pan, place tomato slices in hot pan with chopped basil.</li>
            <li>Allow tomato to cook down into a sauce.</li>
            <li>Assemble sandwich with preferred amount of baby Swiss, baby spinach, roasted mushrooms, and top with tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Either with a buttered pan or buttered bread, heat sandwich to desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
